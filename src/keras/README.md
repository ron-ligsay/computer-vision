## Keras
keras was developed by Fran√ßois Chollet, a Google engineer. It is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

## Keras API
Keras has a modular, multi-backend design. It provides clear and consistent APIs for defining and manipulating different types of models, and for running different types of inference. It also has a number of built-in datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, and pre-trained models for image classification, text classification, and sequence-to-sequence models.

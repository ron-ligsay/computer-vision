# Project Folder
This folder contains the projects that I have done. The projects are listed below.

## Semantic segmentation
Satellite images of Dubai, the UAE segmented into 6 classes using a U-Net architecture.


## Face and eye detection, face recognition adn identification, and facemask detection using tensorflow
utilizing the Haar Cascade Classifierl for face and eye detection,  face recognition and identification, and for facemask detection plus sequential model to classify face with mask and without.
- Face and eye detection - imported model then use webcam to detect face and eyes
- face regonition and identification - to be continued
- facemask detection using tensorflow - kaggle dataset, 12k images, w/without facemask, 328.92MB, 

## basic cv_tensorflow
My study repo on classifying clothes using tensorflow and cv2, using keras sequential model.
- studying

## object detector
to be continued
